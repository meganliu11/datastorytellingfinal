<p>A young woman sits in the corner of a community counseling center in Manhattan’s Chinatown. She scrolls absently on her phone, earbuds tucked in, head down, shoulders tight. Around her, conversations flow in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Korean, with the occasional sound of laughter through otherwise long silences.&nbsp;<br>
<br>When her name is called, she hesitates for a beat, glancing up shyly at the therapist, one of few counselors here who speaks her family’s dialect. As she rises, something lingers in the air. The months, maybe years, it took for her to walk through these doors.&nbsp;<br>
<br>For many young Asian Americans like her, finding help is not the hard part. It’s finding someone who truly understands where they are coming from and why asking for help feels like crossing an invisible line drawn generations ago.

 &nbsp; &nbsp;</blockquote></div>
<p>Since the COVID-19 Pandemic, conversations around mental health have grown louder, especially among Generation Z. But despite this shift, concerns remain. 
    &nbsp;<br><br>A 2024 report from the Asian American Foundation (TAAF) found that nearly 3 in 10 Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) youth aged 14-25 have seriously considered or attempted suicide. That rate is significantly higher than the national average youth for mental health risk, which stands at 20%, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

</div>
<p>The gap is not new. Asian Americans have been the fastest-growing population among all racial and ethnic groups in the United States since 2000, according to the Pew Research Center. 
</p>
<div class="chart">
    <div style="min-height:302px" id="datawrapper-vis-umViY"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/umViY/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-umViY"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/umViY/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>
</div>
<p>Yet despite that growth, they remain the least likely racial group to seek mental health treatment, a trend tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for almost two decades.</p>
<div class="chart">
    <div style="min-height:373px" id="datawrapper-vis-OPiqc"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OPiqc/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-OPiqc"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OPiqc/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<p>While low rates of service use are sometimes viewed to reflect lower levels of distress, the reality is a lack of culturally reflective care and funding in these communities. Barriers to seeking and accessing help have long been shaped by cultural stigma, parental expectations, and structural gaps in care.  
    &nbsp;<br>
    <br>Clinical psychologist Dr. Stanley Sue has long argued that traditional therapy models rooted in Western ideals of individualism and emotional expressiveness, do not always align with Asian American cultural values. Many families emphasize collectivism, a belief that prioritizes family reputation and shared responsibility over individual needs. Within this context, discussing personal struggles can feel inappropriate or even selfish. 
    <div class="chart">
        <div style="min-height:261px" id="datawrapper-vis-lNk4w"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lNk4w/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-lNk4w"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lNk4w/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

    “As an immigrant family I believe that their view on mental health is really different from the more Western aspects of mental health,” said Jessica Chen, 20, a first-generation Chinese American college student. “They think it’s like, ‘Suck it up and deal with it.’”&nbsp;<br><br>
    This framework contributes to one of the most commonly reported stressors among AANHPI youth, the pressure to succeed. According to a 2024 study by The Asian American Foundation (TAAF), that pressure often stems not only from parents, but from internalized expectations and a deep sense of obligation to family. 
    <br></p>
<div class="chart">
    <div style="min-height:276px" id="datawrapper-vis-WoV7t"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WoV7t/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-WoV7t"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WoV7t/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>
</div>
<br><p>This is also reinforced by the model minority myth, a stereotype that portrays Asian Americans as uniformly high-achieving and self-sufficient. While often perceived as positive, it can mask the diversity of experiences and discourage help-seeking. 
</p>
</p><div class="pull-quote-wrapper">
  
    <blockquote class="pull-quote">“I’ve kind of just determined my self worth based &nbsp;in the letter I see in the gradebook.”</blockquote></div><p>“It’s like that’s [grades] what they [parents] think defines you. It's like you are an A or a B also known as the Asian F. That’s definitely taken a toll on me because I’ve kind of determined my self-worth based on the letter I see in the grade book,” said Shruthi Kethamakka, 19, a 2nd generation South Asian American college student. <br><br>“It’s really discouraging to see the grade go down but it’s like we’re not taught improvement, we have to be good from the start and then good to the finish.”
        &nbsp;<br>
<br>As a result, many young people turn to friends rather than parents or a mental health professionals. <br>

   </div>
<p>In several states, the age of consent for mental health services is 18 or older, which means parental permission is often required to access care.</p>

  </div>
<p>Even when younger Asian American youth do seek support, many struggle to find providers who share their cultural background or speak their language.
    <br> 
<br>
According to the American Psychological Association (APA), only 4% of psychologists in the U.S. identify as Asian. </p>

<p><br>Alyx Ang, 23, a social media manager and mental health advocate, said the lack of representation can deter young people from seeking help. After several discouraging experiences with therapists who didn’t share her background, she stopped going for years until a culturally responsive provider changed her perspective. 
    &nbsp;<br>
    <br>“I think speaking to an Asian therapist is the first time I felt the care that I was getting was based on a very personal and deep experience,” said Ang. “And from a nuanced view, it wasn't just like a textbook definition that I feel I got from some of my non-cultural providers.”<br>
   <br> “There are just certain nuances that are very inherent to the experience of being an Asian American that I don't unfortunately think you can study or read about,” she added. 
   
   <div class="pull-quote-wrapper">

A 2016 study by Dr. Gordon C. Hall and colleagues, published in Behavior Therapy, found that culturally adapted cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) those that incorporate cultural identity, communication styles, and client values, were significantly more likely to help people recover from mental health disorders like depression or anxiety compared to non-adapted, standard therapies.<br>
<br>Organizations like the National Asian American Pacific Islander Mental Health Association (NAAPIMHA) are working to bring cultural awareness into mental health care. 

<br><br>“Cultural humility is learning everything you can about that person and approaching treatment from there.” said Dr. Pata Suyemoto, executive director of NAAPIMHA and a national trainer in Mental Health First Aid & Achieving Whole Health. 

<br><br>Suyemoto said culturally responsive care includes offering therapy in multiple Asian languages, recruiting multilingual staff, training providers in cultural awareness, and involving family and community members in treatment decisions. 

<br><br>Yet for most AANHPI youth, culturally rooted services remain the exception, not the norm. Awareness alone is not enough to close the gap between need and care. 
&nbsp;<br><br>According to a 2019 analysis published in JAMA Network Open, only 0.2% of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding between 1992 and 2018 was awarded to studies involving Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander participants. 
<br><br>Asian Americans are projected to become the largest immigrant group in the U.S. by 2055. Yet current levels of research and funding fail to reflect the population’s growth or diversity, according to TAAF. 
<br><br>Without expanded access to culturally responsive care and increased funding for research, young AANHPI individuals may continue to face the same neglect that has shaped outcomes for decades. 
<br><br>As The Asian American Foundation writes in its 2024 report: “To change the status quo for mental health, we need to meet people where they are.”</p>

Note: This article uses “Asian American” when referring to specific cultural experiences and interviews. When citing sources that include Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations, the term “AANHPI” is used to reflect the broader demographic classification found in those sources. While Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations are often grouped under broader terms like “AAPI” or “AANHPI”, their histories, identities, and mental health challenges are distinct.

How I made this: I coded this with vs and github and gitpages, I used AI / chatgpt to help me troubleshoot the coding (esp the landing page javascript fade). I prompted it to help me create a starting template for a news style article and then I adjusted it from there! The charts were made with data I compiled onto a spreadsheet and then I either made it through sheets or datawrapper. For example, I made the landing graphic through figma and wanted it to “fade” so I asked chatgpt to help me input a code that would make that happen.&nbsp;<br><br>
